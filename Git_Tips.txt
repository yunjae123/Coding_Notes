git init
turns a non-git folder into a git repository
that creates a new subdirectory named .git
it's always in relation to the current working directory

ls -a
lists all files in the current directory

git add 
adds untracked files to git

git diff --name-only --cached
this shows all the staged files that are "added"

git commit -m "Added title" -m "some description"
After git commit, the repository is now up to date.

git tag v0.1
this creates a tag to that specific commit that you can use "checkout" to move to

git push origin master
pushes all the files to github.com

git remote add origin "ssh link here"
if you created a git repo on your local machine, this command pushes it onto github

git remote -v
checked to see if your local repo is connected to a remote repo

git push -u origin master
allows you to not type out "origin master" next time you push onto github

git branch
shows what branches you have on a repo

git checkout -b feature
this will create and go to the new branch that you created "feature"

git checkout "branch"
this will go to the branch you specified

git branch -d feature
deletes the branch that you finished using

git diff master
if you type this from your feature branch, it will show the difference in code between master/feature

git merge feature (be on MAIN) - This is the correct way to merge your main to feature
when your feature branch is a couple commits ahead, you can move to your main branch (that's behind) and this code above will Fast-forward merge the main branch up-to-date with the feature branch

git merge master (be on FEATURE) - This goes backwards, so a no-go?
if you type this from your feature branch, it will merge your feature branch onto the master branch

esc && :wq
when you have merging conflicts, after having resolved them, this is how you navigate in your vim editor

git reset README.md (no arguments will reset all the files added)
this will unstage a file. this does NOT undo the commit

git reset HEAD~1
this will completely undo the commit that you last made.

git log
shows all the git commits that you made and wrote. this is where you can copy and paste the hash shown to go back to a commit.

git reset "paste hash here"
does what i just described ^

git reset --hard "paste hash here"
it resets to THAT point and undoes all the changes that you made. good for restarting
