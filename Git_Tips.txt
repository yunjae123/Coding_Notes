After git commit, the repository is now up to date.

git push origin master

git init

git remote add origin "ssh link here"
if you created a git repo on your local machine, this command pushes it onto github

git remote -v
checked to see if your local repo is connected to a remote repo

git push -u origin master
allows you to not type out "origin master" next time you push onto github

git branch

git checkout -b feature-readme-instruction
this will create and go to the new branch that you created

git checkout "branch"
this will go to the branch you specified

git branch -d feature-readme-instruction
deletes the branch that you finished using

git diff master
if you type this from your feature branch, it will show the difference in code between master/feature

git merge master

git reset README.md (no arguments will reset all the files added)
this will unstage a file. this does NOT undo the commit

git reset HEAD~1
this will completely undo the commit that you last made.

git log
shows all the git commits that you made and wrote. this is where you can copy and paste the hash shown to go back to a commit.

git reset "paste hash here"
does what i just described ^

git reset --hard "paste hash here"
it resets to THAT point and undoes all the changes that you made. good for restarting
